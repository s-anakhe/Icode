Daisies, with their charming simplicity and vibrant hues, are a diverse family of flowers known for their cheerful appearance and adaptability. The classic white Shasta daisy, with its bright yellow center and snow-white petals, symbolizes purity and innocence, while the Gerbera daisy offers a bold array of colors, from fiery oranges to soothing pinks, making it a favorite in floral arrangements. African daisies, or Osteospermum, add a unique twist with their vivid, often bi-colored blooms that can even shift hues with changing light. Meanwhile, the English daisy, smaller and more delicate, is known for its compact, charming flower head that features a mix of white or pink petals and a yellow center. Each type of daisy brings its own special flair, whether through its color, size, or growing habits, adding a touch of natural beauty wherever they grow.</p>
