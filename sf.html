        Sunflowers, with their towering stems and bold, cheerful blooms, are a vibrant symbol of summer and positivity. Native to the Americas, these iconic flowers are known for their large, round heads that follow the sun's path across the sky, a phenomenon known as heliotropism. Sunflowers come in various types, each with distinct characteristics. The classic Helianthus annuus features large, bright yellow petals and a dark center, ideal for making a dramatic statement in gardens. Dwarf varieties, like the Teddy Bear, offer a compact size and fluffy, double blooms perfect for smaller spaces or containers. Ornamental sunflowers, such as the Italian White or Red Sun, provide a unique twist with their unusual colors and sizes. Additionally, multi-branched types like the ProCut series are favored for their cutting garden appeal, producing multiple smaller blooms on each plant. Each type of sunflower brings its own special charm, enhancing landscapes with their sunny disposition and versatility.</p>
